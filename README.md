I'm Henry Partridge, an open data scientist and [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query&f=live) cheerleader. I am the manager of the [Trafford Data Lab](https://www.trafforddatalab.io), part of [Trafford Council](https://www.trafford.gov.uk). I have an academic background in philosophy and crime science with operational experience in intelligence analysis with the police and London's transport authority. I have [published articles](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4400-1262) on spatial network analysis, organised crime, transport-related crime and hotspots policing. 

Here's a list of some of the projects that I'm currently working on:   

* [COVID-19 dashboards](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/covid19): a suite of apps built in [R](https://cran.r-project.org) [Shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html) that visualise the latest confirmed coronavirus cases in local authorities in England. The apps are designed to help support local authorities with their COVID-19 response and inform residents about trends in infection rates.
* [Climate Emergency slide pack](https://trafforddatalab.shinyapps.io/climate_emergency): an [R](https://cran.r-project.org) [Shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html) app that enables UK councils - and their residents - to build a slide pack of data visualisations relating to climate change for their local authority.
