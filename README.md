Hi, I'm Henry. I'm a data scientist at the UK Government's [Office for National Statistics]([https://onsvisual.github.io/project_cairo/](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk)). I have an academic background in philosophy and crime science with operational experience in intelligence analysis with the police and London's transport authority. I have [published articles](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4400-1262) on spatial network analysis, organised crime, transport-related crime and hotspots policing.
