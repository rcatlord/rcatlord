Hi, I'm Henry. I create data visualisations at the UK Government's [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk). I was previously the manager of the [Trafford Data Lab](https://www.trafforddatalab.io), part of [Trafford Council](https://www.trafford.gov.uk). I have an academic background in philosophy and crime science with operational experience in intelligence analysis with the police and London's transport authority. I have [published articles](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4400-1262) on spatial network analysis, organised crime, transport-related crime and hotspots policing.
